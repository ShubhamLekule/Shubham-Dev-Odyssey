//Problem Description
//You'll write some code to help you cook a gorgeous lasagna from your favorite cookbook. Now, you also want to add a few layers to the lasagna. Assume **each layer takes 2 minutes** to prepare. Given the number of layers you want to add to the lasagna, find how many minutes you would spend making them.
//
//
//Input Format
//The only first line contains the integer N denoting the number of layers.
//
//
//Output Format
//Print in a single line how many minutes are required to prepare N layers.
//
//
//Example Input
//Input:-
//2
//
//
//Example Output
//Output:-
//4
//
//
//Example Explanation
//Note: The problem constraints mean that when we test your code, the test cases used in the backend can have input values only within those constraints. You need not implement them in your code. You must ensure your code will work for all such input values!
import java.util.Scanner;
public class PreparationTime {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// YOUR CODE GOES HERE
        // Please take input and print output to standard input/output (stdin/stdout)
        // DO NOT USE ARGUMENTS FOR INPUTS
        // E.g. 'Scanner' for input & 'System.out' for output
        System.out.print(2*new Scanner(System.in).nextInt());
