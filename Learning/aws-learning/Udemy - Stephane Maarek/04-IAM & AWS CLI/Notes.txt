IAM
-Identity and Access Management
-It is a global service
-Root Account created by default , shouldn't be used or shared
-Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped (Root account can't be
  shared instead create user in IAM and shared that)
- One user represent one person within your organization.
- Users can be grouped
-Groups only contain users not other groups
-User don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

Example :
Suppose below people in an organization

SHUBHAM FULL-STACK DEVELOPER
PIKACHU FULL-STACK DEVELOPER
ALICE BACKEND DEVELOPER
BOB BACKEND DEVELOPER
CHARLES BACKEND DEVELOPER
DAVID FRONTEND DEVELOPER
EDWARD FRONTEND DEVELOPER
FRED OPERATIONS

BELOW ARE THE GROUPS CAN BE FORMED WHERE SHUBHAM AND PIKACHU ARE PART OF MULTIPLE GROUPS AND
FRED IS NOT PART OF ANY GROUPS:

BACKEND DEVELOPERS {SHUBHAM, PIKACHU, ALICE, BOB, CHARLES}
FRONTEND DEVELOPERS {SHUBHAM, PIKACHU, DAVID, EDWARD}
FULL-STACK DEVELOPER {SHUBHAM, PIKACHU}
{FRED}


IAM: Permissions
-USERS or GROUPS can be assigned JSON documents called policies
e.g,
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "ec2:Describe*",
  "Resource": "*"
},
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "elasticloadbalancing:Describe*",
  "Resource": "*"
},
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
    "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
    "cloudwatch:Describe*"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
]
}

- These policies define the permissions of the users
- In AWS you apply least privilege principal: don't give more permissions than a user needs
